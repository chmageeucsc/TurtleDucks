# TurtleDucks

This is a recreation of the classic game, Snake.

The role of the player is to control a mother turtle duck and save her baby ducklings. The player can use the arrow keys to control which direction the mother duck swims. When the player collides with a baby duckling, the game will respawn the 2 baby ducklings in random spots on the board as well as 2 new lilypads (obstacles).
